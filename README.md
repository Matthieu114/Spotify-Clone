# Spotify Clone

This project's aim was to replicate the <a href='https://open.spotify.com/search'>Spotify web player</a>. It allows a user to authenticate through `OAuth2` using the Spotify Web Api. The users songs, playlists, albums and more are then dynamically fetched and displayed in a fully responsive interface. A user can <span>play</span>, <span>pause</span>, <span>skip forwards</span>, or{' '} <span>skip backwards</span>, to a song in a playlist or an album thanks to the client side JS library `Web Playback SDK` .
